"resonance" is a browser app for music lovers who are open to new discoveries.

## Motivation

This project was created as part of my graduation from the neuefische coding bootcamp.\
I am a great music enthusiast myself and can never get enough of new inspiration. So I developed an app that helps to discover and manage new artists quick and easy.
